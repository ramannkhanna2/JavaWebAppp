1. Verify the Installed Java Version
Run the following command to check the current Java version on your system:

java -version
If it shows a version lower than 17, you'll need to install JDK 17.


2. Install JDK 17
If your system doesn't have JDK 17 installed, you can download and install it. Depending on your operating system, the steps may differ:
On Ubuntu (or Debian-based systems):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk


3. Run the Spring Boot Application
Once the JAR file is on the server and you have JDK 17 installed, you can start the Spring Boot application using the following command:


java -jar /root/JavaWebAppp/target/javaazurewebapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081
This will start your Spring Boot application with its embedded server (e.g., Tomcat). By default, it will listen on port 8080, unless specified otherwise in the application.properties or application.yml file.


4. Run in the Background (Optional)
If you want your Spring Boot application to run in the background, you can use nohup or screen.
Using nohup:

nohup java -jar /root/JavaWebAppp/target/javaazurewebapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081 &
This command will run the application in the background and you can safely log out without stopping the application. The output will be written to a file called nohup.out in the current directory.


Note : make sure open the port in firewall â€¦.
